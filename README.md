# Introduction
This repository contains a replication study of several state-of-the-art models in literatures focusing on motor imagery EEG signals. Further, experiments on some unaddressed questions are carried out and recorded. This project aims to:
* Provide pre-processed, augmented, and ready-to-use motor imagery EEG dataset **BCIC-IV-2A**
* Compare the cross-subject performances of models including fundamental **CNN**, **LSTM** models, hybrid models, **EEGNet-8,2** model, **EEG-TCNet** model, and **EEGNeX** model
* Enable other researchers to conveniently carry out cross-subject comparisons on their datasets
* Investigate the efficacy of incorporating Attention layer in the EEGNet-8,2 model
